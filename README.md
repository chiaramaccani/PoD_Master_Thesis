# Simulation studies for a double-crystal channeling experiment at the LHC

### Abstract:
A challenging experiment aiming to measure charm baryon electromagnetic dipole moment with a double-crystal setup is proposed at LHC. Simulation studies are needed in order to define the setup for proof of principles tests that will be carried out during Run 3. The work conducted in this thesis focused on the integration, optimization and tests in the DD4hep framework of the Geant4 crystal channeling routine and on the estimation of the particles' background that can be observed in a scoring plane detector placed after the second crystal.
